## üìå Motivation

Managing a hospital involves handling large volumes of data and ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility. Traditional systems often rely on paper-based or fragmented digital solutions, which can lead to inefficiencies and errors.  

The motivation behind this project is to:
- Simplify hospital workflows by centralizing data.  
- Enable healthcare professionals to quickly access patient and institutional records.  
- Improve patient care by streamlining appointments, admissions, and prescriptions.  
- Provide administrators with better control over hospital resources (staff, rooms, vehicles, medications).

The system is backed by a **MySQL database schema** (`create_hms.sql`) that defines core entities such as:

- **Institution**: Hospital or clinic details.  
- **Employee**: Doctors, nurses, surgeons, laboratory technicians.  
- **Patient**: Patient records with UMCN as a unique identifier.  
- **Appointments & Admissions**: Scheduling and hospital stays.  
- **Medical Records & Prescriptions**: Treatment history and medication tracking.  
- **Laboratory Tests & Results**: Diagnostic management.  
- **Vehicles & Drivers**: For hospital logistics and emergency needs.  
- **Administration**: Administrators and their actions.
